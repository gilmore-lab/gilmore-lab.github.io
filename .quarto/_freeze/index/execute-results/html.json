Our goal is to understand patterns of brain and behavioral change in infants, children, and young adults. We use behavioral, EEG, MRI, and computational modeling methods in our research. We also advocate for and try to demonstrate open science practices in our work. \n\n## Contact Information\n\nDr. [Rick Gilmore](https://psych.la.psu.edu/directory/rog1), Professor of Psychology, ([rogilmore@psu.edu](mailto:rogilmore@psu.edu); 814-865-3664; 114 Moore Building) directs the lab.\n\n[Andrea Seisler](mailto:ars17@psu.edu) is the Lab Manager.\n\n## [For Students](who-we-are.html)\n\nThe lab employs an active and engaged group of undergraduate and graduate research assistants. If you are a Penn State undergraduate student and wish to be considered for a position in the lab, complete an online application [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1HgafpfTVPyMk_Wzf4b_ubzig_fs4lFGS6qh_y0sa0uE/viewform). **We are FULL for Fall 2023 and Spring 2024**\n\nIf you are a prospective graduate student, contact Dr. Gilmore by email.  For more information about current students and alumni, see the [student page](who-we-are.html). \n\n## [For Parents](parents.html)\n\nMuch of our research involves testing infants and young children.
