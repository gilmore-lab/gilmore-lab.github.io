To reach this goal, we use behavioral, EEG and MRI techniques to study how the infant, child and adult brain responds to motion and pattern.\n\nIf you are interested in participating in a study or having your child participate, please contact us at psubrainlab@gmail.com.\n\n<!-- ## EEG Studies -->\n\n<!-- EEG (Electroencephalogram) is a technique which allows the electrical signals in the brain to be recorded. In these studies we are recording the brain activity while the participants watch images on a computer monitor. The studies at our lab take approximately 1 hour.  -->\n\n<!-- - We do not have an active study at this time -->\n\n<!-- ## Behavioral Studies -->\n\n<!-- ### Individual Differences in Motion Perceiption -->\n<!-- In this study, participants will view black and white stripes and have to make a determination about what they see. In addition, participants will also complete some questionnaires. -->\n\n<!-- Recruitment for this study takes place through the [Psychology Subject Pool](http://pennstate.sona-systems.com/) for students for Psych 100 and Psych 105. -->\n\n<!-- ### Symmetry Sorting Study   -->\n<!-- We are studying how the brain perceives symmetry in two-dimensions. Participants view a series of images and group them into similar categories. -->\n\n<!-- - We do not have an active study at this time. -->\n\n<!-- ### Detection of Optic Flow -->\n\n<!-- In this study, participants view two images side by side on a computer screen and have to choose which one has coherent motion.  -->\n\n<!-- - We do not have an active study at this time -->\n\n<!-- ## MRI Studies -->\n<!-- Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) provides information about blood flow in the brain. This technique allows us to determine the areas of the brain that are active while viewing a particular stimuli.   -->\n\n<!-- - We do not have an active study at this time.  -->\n",
