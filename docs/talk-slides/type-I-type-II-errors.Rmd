```

## Purpose

To discuss Type I and Type II errors and how they relate to the idea of statistical power.

## Making decisions

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("https://mk0abtastybwtpirqi5t.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/type-1-2-errors.png")
```

## Setting decision thresholds

- Goal: Minimize the probability of making errors
- Types of errors
    - False positives: Nothing's going on, but we say otherwise (Type I)
    - False negatives: Something's going on, but we miss it (Type II)

## What do we control? What do we measure?

- Control
    - Sample size
    - Decision criteria
    - How big a difference (effect size) actually matters
    - Width of "null" or reference distribution
- Measure
    - Outcomes and their variability

## Bottom line

- Need bigger samples to detect smaller effects with confidence
