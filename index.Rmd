# Rick Gilmore's Lab @ Penn State

The Gilmore Lab in the [Psychology Department](https://psych.la.psu.edu) at [Penn State](https://www.psu.edu) studies the development of perception, action, and memory. Our goal is to understand patterns of brain and behavioral change in infants, children, and young adults. We use behavioral, EEG, MRI, and computational modeling methods in our research. We also advocate for and try to demonstrate open science practices in our work. 

<!-- ## Active Projects -->

<!-- We have several active projects related to visual perception and open science that are described [here](research.html). You can also get a taste of what we do by visiting the <a href="https://databrary.org">Databrary</a> digital data library, specifically the page devoted to <a href="https://databrary.org/party/6">our research</a>. -->

## DataCamp

Most students who work as research assistants in the lab do so for PSY 494 course credit.

This class is supported by DataCamp, an intuitive learning platform for data science. Learn R, Python and SQL the way you learn best through a combination of short expert videos and hands-on-the-keyboard exercises. Take over 100+ courses by expert instructors on topics such as importing data, data visualization or machine learning and learn faster through immediate and personalised feedback on every exercise.
