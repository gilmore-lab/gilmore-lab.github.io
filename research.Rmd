## Open Science

The social, behavioral, and neural sciences face more difficult scientific challenges than any other field has faced before.
Open, transparent, and reproducible scientific practices are essential for accelerating discovery in these fields.
My colleagues and I are developing policies for the ethical and secure sharing of personal data and technologies to allow the analysis and sharing of these data for scientific and educational purposes.

The [Databrary Project ](http://databrary.org) aims to increase scientific transparency and accelerate discovery in developmental science by building infrastructure for researchers to share video data and related meta-data. The project has five specific aims:

- Create a web-based [data library](http://databrary.org) for sharing and preserving video data and associated meta-data.
- Create participant and contributor/user standards that enable open sharing of video data while limiting access to authorized users to ensure participant confidentiality.
- Expand the free, open source video coding software, [Datavyu](http://datavyu.org) to enable coding, exploring, and analyzing video data.
- Build a data management system to support data sharing within labs, among collaborators, and in the Databrary repository.
- Transform the culture of developmental science by building a community of researchers committed to open video data sharing.

Databrary is an [open-source](http://github.com/databrary) software project. Penn State is one of the major "nodes", with a large number of authorized users.

## Play & Learning Across a Year (PLAY)

The Play & Learning Across a Year (PLAY) project serves as a model system for doing development science from a "big" data approach. Natural free play represents the foundation of infant learning, but we know little about how infants play, how play unfolds in real time and across development, and how individual and group differences promote infant learning and development through play. To answer these questions, the PLAY project will collect, code, and share 900 hours of video collected in the homes of children at 12, 18, and 24 months of age drawn from 30 sites across North America.

The aim of the project is to develop a new approach to developmental science that enables (1) “big” data science for researchers who would not otherwise have access; (2) a communal, low-cost means of collecting and coding data that retains the autonomy of individual labs; and (3) a plan for leveraging diverse expertise to address a common goal.

## Developmental Dynamics of Optic Flow Processing

![Brain activity](images/fesi-2014.jpg) ![Optic flow](images/optic-flow.jpg)

Visual motion provides humans and animals with information about their own movement through 3D space and about the structure of the environment -- the objects, surfaces, and other animals that it may contain. How the human brain processes complex motion information poses an as-yet unanswered question. This project focuses on characterizing how sensitivity to visual motion emerges in the developing human brain: how brain (EEG) responses to patterns of ego- and object motion emerge, how they develop from infancy through childhood into adulthood, how specific changes in cortical circuitry might account for the observed patterns, and how behavioral sensitivity to motion corresponds to neural activation. The studies compare brain responses and behavioral discrimination patterns in infants, children, and adults to the same types of ego- and object motion. The studies also involve an effort to measure or simulate the statistics of optic flow experienced by infant, child, and adult observers in complex, natural environments using computer vision methods.

## The Proximal Emotional Environment Project (PEEP)

A 5-year-old overhears her parents arguing loudly in the next room. She may not understand why they are arguing, but she realizes something is wrong because she perceives anger in their voices. Exposure to interpersonal conflict is consistently associated with less skillful emotion regulation in children although the mechanisms remain to be explained. Because inter-personal conflict is a heterogeneous phenomenon, investigation of the specific features of conflict that contribute to developmental pathways to emotional dysfunction and symptoms requires a process-oriented approach. In this project, we focus on brain responses to angry prosody in natural speech. We are studying young children’s neural processing of angry prosody, spoken by mothers and strangers, as a first step toward a future longitudinal study investigating how the neurocognitive processing of angry prosody mediates relations between conflict exposure in children and the development of anxiety- and anger-related symptoms.

## Eye Tracking Technologies to Characterize and Optimize Visual Attending in Down Syndrome

Down Syndrome (DS) is the most common known genetic origin of intellectual disability and has an estimated incidence of 1 in every 1000 live births. Such children face unique challenges as they enter into the school years, because the speech that was previously adequate for communication with familiar partners in supportive settings is often not sufficient for academic communication with unfamiliar partners. Indeed, 95% of parents surveyed reported that their children with DS had difficulty being understood by persons outside their immediate social circle (Kumin, 1994). This has significant implications for academic, social, and vocational success; children with limited language skills are at risk of falling behind nondisabled peers academically and experiencing social isolation. Secondary issues often arise when children experience frustration in communication, commonly in the form of challenging behaviors. All aspects of development are further compromised when these behaviors involve aggression toward others, have significant health implications when they are self-injurious, and exacerbate service costs when they necessitate extensive behavior management plans. Children with DS are in desperate need of communication interventions that provide them with the tools to succeed throughout the school years. One form of intervention is called aided augmentative and alternative communication (AAC). In typical clinical applications, aided AAC systems employ picture books, tablet-style computers that present the user with graphic symbols, and sometimes text or synthesized voice output. Because AAC relies on vision rather than sound/speech for access to the communication messages, it is critical to map out how children with DS examine and extract information from visual AAC displays. Otherwise there is the risk of implementing systems that are poorly matched to children's skills and needs, a practice that in turn results in limited use or abandonment of the system. Few current AAC designs consider the fit between the system and the visual processing skills of users, and most are uninformed by empirical knowledge about human visual information processing. Moreover, little is known about visual processing in persons with significant communication limitations associated with DS. This research aims to improve the design of AAC displays through characterization of visual attention patterns to different AAC displays and their effects on functional use. Eye tracking - rarely used in DS - will reveal attention patterns/processes that typically go unrecorded in behavioral research. Our three-phase program will begin with eye tracking studies of visual attention under largely non-social laboratory conditions. In the next phase, we will introduce social interactions and record gaze path using mobile eye tracking technology. In the final phase, we will translate the knowledge gained in the laboratory studies to optimize functional communication in individuals with DS in performing tasks that represent typical daily life activities.

## Computational Symmetry

![Symmetric image](images/symmetry-sample-1.png) ![Symmetric image](images/symmetry-sample-2.png)

The ability to sense regular or near-regular patterns serves critical biological needs and is equally important for computer vision and machine intelligence. Despite wide variation in the types of regularity present in natural images, research on human and computer processing of pattern regularity has focused primarily on detecting bilateral reflection symmetry, using largely atheoretical approaches. The goals of this interdisciplinary research are to i) use principles of group theory to develop a conceptual framework for understanding regularity perception and brain activation in humans, and ii) to design general computer-based symmetry detection algorithms that can operate at a level of practical usability.
