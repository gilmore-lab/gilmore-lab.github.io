Belle is currently preparing to apply to medical school, with the goal of eventually becoming a Pediatrician and working with underserved pediatric populations, both domestically and abroad. Belle is passionate about the intersections between physiological and psychological health, and has had the opportunity to pursue this interest during her time in the Gilmore Lab, as well as through the founding of her artificial intelligence based start-up, Apoio, which focuses on improving the intake process for mental health providers in rural/remote regions. Belle is also involved with [Alpha Phi Omega](https://apo.org) and [Remote Area Medical](https://www.ramusa.org), which are both student-run service organizations on campus. In her free time, Belle enjoys swimming, baking, and trying new coffee shops.\n\n:::\n\n::::\n\n## Recent Alumni\n\n- Yiming Qian, Ph.D.\n- Cecelia Petrarca\n- Kayla Moninger\n- Kavya Jhaveri\n- Bowen
