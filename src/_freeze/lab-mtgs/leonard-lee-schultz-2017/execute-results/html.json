Infants make more attempts to achieve a goal when they see adults persist. *Science*, *357*(6357), 1290–1294.

Button presses were coded from videotape by two coders blind to hypotheses and condition (inter-rater reliability $r = .99, p < .001$). Data from a single coder was used for analyses but all results held with the second coder’s data. Coders agreed with the experimenter’s judgment on the termination of the experiment 100% of the time.\" \n\n(Supplement, p. 2)\n\n---\n\n>\"Additionally, a coder blind to condition and hypotheses\ncoded the tapes for potential confounds. No difference was found across the conditions for whether the parent talked to the child ($\\chi^2 (2, N=102)=1.03$, $p = .60$), parents’ proximity to the infant (as distance in inches, $H(2) = 4.32$, $p = .12$), and parents’ encouragement to the infant ($\\chi^2 (2, N = 102) = 5.56$, $p = .06$). Additionally, because the experimenter might have conveyed more enthusiasm in handing the toy to the child in the Effort than the No Effort condition, a second coder rated the experimenter’s enthusiasm at the start of the test trial on a Likert scale, blind to conditions ($W = 525$, $p = .50$).\"\n\n(Supplement, p. 2)\n\n## Questions, cheers, & lamentations\n\n### Questions\n\n- Could 'effort' be based on personal qualities of child?\n- Differences in environment (noise, what parent did, etc.)?\n- What do parents & siblings do (for work, at home)?\n- Would parent as demonstrator elicit stronger responses from kid?\n- How does child's attention span affect outcome?\n- Individual differences in child's interest in the toy?\n\n### Cheers\n\n- Preregistration of replication\n- Show video exemplars\n- Shared [data and analysis scripts](https://osf.io/xjz8e/).\n\n## Lamentations\n\n- Plots don't show individual responses (but we could fix with data file)\n- Focus only on button pressing, lots of other behaviors that might have distinguished groups\n- Could share videos of all participants on Databrary so other researchers could follow up\n- *Science* article space limitations causes important details to be 'buried' in teh supplementary materials\n",
