Gilmore is Associate Professor of Psychology, a Huck Institute of the Life Sciences faculty member, and an Associate of the Institute for Cyberscience. He earned his bachelor's degree *magna cum laude* in Cognitive Science from [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu), and master's and doctoral degrees in Psychology from [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu) where he participated in the [Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition (CNBC)](https://cnbc.cmu.edu) training program in cognitive neuroscience. Gilmore's research focuses on the development of visual perception and memory. He is particularly interested in the development of brain networks that enable perceivers to extract information about the layout of the environment, the shape of objects, and the speed and direction of self-movement from patterns of visual motion called optic flow. Gilmore is also keenly interested in developing tools and practices that make scientific research more open, transparent, and reproducible. He is co-founder and Co-Director of the [Databrary.org](https://databrary.org) data library.\n\nFrom 2008 to 2014, Gilmore served as the founding Director of Human Imaging at Penn State's Social, Life, and Engineering Sciences Imaging Center [(SLEIC)](https://imaging.psu.edu). He has won the College of the Liberal Arts tenure-line faculty teaching award, leads the Human Developmental Neuroscience Initiative for the Child Study Center, and has had support for his research from the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation. Gilmore has served as president of the [Centre Region Bicycle Coalition](https://centrebike.org), the [Acoustic Brew Concert Series](https://acousticbrew.org), and the [State College Community Theatre](https://scctonline.org).\n\n## Contact Information\n\n<p>114 Moore Building<br/>\nDepartment of Psychology<br/>\nThe Pennsylvania State University<br/>\nUniversity Park, PA 16801<br/>\n814-865-3664, voice <br/>\n814-863-7002, fax<br/>\n\nrogilmore AT-SIGN psu DOT edu<br/>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.personal.psu.edu/rog1\">https://www.personal.psu.edu/rog1</a></br>\n\n# For Students\n\nThe Brain Development Lab, part of the [Psychology Department](https://psych.la.psu.edu) at Penn State, is looking for research assistants to study brain development in infants, children, and adolescents for **Fall 2023**. You can earn research project (PSY 494) credit or work study funds, and learn video, computer, and communication skills. Prior research experience and computer skills are a plus, but aren't required. We are especially interested in students who have morning availability, computer skills, or are interested in developing skills in advertising, marketing, or public relations. You may apply by completing an [application](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1HgafpfTVPyMk_Wzf4b_ubzig_fs4lFGS6qh_y0sa0uE/viewform).\n\n**We are full for Fall 2023**\n\n## Current Staff\n\n### [Andrea Seisler](mailto:ars17psu@gmail.com), Lab Manager\nAndrea R. Seisler is the Laboratory Manager of the Brain Development Laboratory directed by Dr. Rick O. Gilmore. She received her bachelor's and master's degree in Biomedical Engineering from [The Catholic University of America](https://www.cua.edu/). During her graduate studies, she was a recipient of the [Clare Booth Luce Fellowship](https://www.hluce.org/cblprogram.aspx) award.\n\nShe completed MRI based neuroscience and orthopedics research while working at [The National Institutes of Health](https://www.nih.gov/) from 2001-2007. After her move to State College, she served as an IRB Compliance Coordinator for the [Office for Research Protections](https://www.research.psu.edu/orp/humans) at Penn State and then moved on to manage the Human Electrophysiology Facility located at the [Social, Life, and Enginineering Sciences Imaging Center](https://www.imaging.psu.edu/) through 2014.\n\n#### Contact Information\n\n<p>503 Moore Building<br/>\nDepartment of Psychology<br/>\nThe Pennsylvania State University<br/>\nUniversity Park, PA 16802<br/>\nars17 AT-SIGN psu DOT edu</p>\n\n### Yiming Qian\n\nYiming is the graduate student in the Department of Psychology at PSU. Her research interests is exploring the development of brain networks from early childhood to adulthood, using neuroimaging tools. She is also interested in the mechanism of visual motion. \n\nBesides research activities, Yiming enjoys reading, cooking, gardening, hiking and fishing. She is a big fan of operas and musicals.\n\n### Sarah Shahriar\n\nSarah is a junior majoring in Psychology with a concentration in Neuroscience. She hopes to pursue a medical degree after studying at Penn State University and hopes to practice as a psychiatrist in the future. \n\nSarah is originally from Hershey, PA and enjoys spending her time volunteering at Penn State Hershey Medical Center Childrenâ€™s Hospital within the Ronald McDonald charities. \n\n## Recent Alumni\n\n- Alyssa Pandos\n- Charmi Mehta\n- Raya Willoughby\n- Katie Torres\n- Shivani Patel\n- Michael O'Neill, Graduate student, PSU\n- Daved Fared\n- Auburn Lattanzio\n- Michelle Shade\n- Sam Pai\n- Jun Oh, Apprentice Ruby on Rails Developer, Launch Academy, Inc.\n- Amanda Thomas, Postdoctoral researcher, Swarthmore\n- William Adamiak, NIH IRTA\n- Shivam Vedak, Medical student\n- Dan Elbich, Graduate student, Penn State\n- Jeremy Fesi, Ph.D., US Marine Corps Research\n- Lorena Gonzalez, Graduate student, Penn State\n- Ricky Groner, IT Support Specialist, Huck Institutes of the Life Sciences, Penn State\n- Ken Hwang, Consultant, Anexinet\n- Matthew Lee, MBA student, Penn State\n- Patricia Jones, Optometry student, Pennsylvania College of Optometry\n",
