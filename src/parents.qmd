# For Parents

Some parents are surprised to learn how much we can learn from studies of infants and children. Dr. Gilmore has been conducting research with infants and children for more than 20 years, and he has two daughters of his own who have been regular participants in research studies. The Penn State Brain and Behavioral Dynamics Lab works very hard to ensure that you and your child will be safe and comfortable at all times and that everyone enjoys their visit to the lab. This page is designed to help parents prepare for a visit. If you have a question this page does not answer, please email ([rogilmore@psu.edu](mailto:rogilmore@psu.edu)) or call (814-865-3664) Dr. Gilmore.

We want to learn about babies' everyday experiences in their homes—such as the things they play with and the places they go. A researcher will video record you and your baby during your everyday activities in your home and ask you questions about your baby’s development. Visits take 2-3 hours. As thanks, you’ll receive a $50 gift card!

Your baby must be 12, 18, or 24 months old and families must speak only English and/or Spanish. Visit [http://anhourinthelife.org/](http://anhourinthelife.org/) to learn more and sign up!
