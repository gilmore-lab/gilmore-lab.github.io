Trinity led a work journal club, and we discussed about [Further Recommendation in the Technique of Psycho-Analysis](https://gilmore-lab.github.io/lab-mtg-talks/freud-further-recommendation.pdf)

- Key Findings
1. The analyst must remain neutral and objective, avoiding personal involvement.
2. Free association helps uncover unconscious material, with resistance as a key focus.
3. Transference is crucial for therapy, but the analyst must manage it carefully.
4. Overcoming resistance is essential for progress in analysis.
