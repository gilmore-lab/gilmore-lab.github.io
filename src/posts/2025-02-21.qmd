Julia led a work journal club for [Legacy Project: Visual Acuity](https://gilmore-lab.github.io/visual-acuity/).

We discussed about [Palmer et al. (2005) â€“ 15-Year Outcomes Following Threshold Retinopathy of Prematurity](https://doi.org/10.1001/archopht.123.3.311)
Key Findings
- Cryotherapy-treated eyes had a significantly lower rate of blindness compared to untreated eyes.
- Despite treatment, a substantial proportion of children still had visual impairment.
- Retinal structure abnormalities remained common in both treated and untreated groups.
- Long-term adverse effects of cryotherapy were noted, including myopia (nearsightedness) and structural ocular changes.
