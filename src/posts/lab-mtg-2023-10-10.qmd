Rick talked about the Datasaurus dozen (see figure above).
This is an entertaining demonstration about the importance of visualizing data.

The visual acuity project team discussed the draft protocol.

Rick and Andrea ran a how-to session based on some reaction time data Andrea collected in her son Alex's class last year.
We discussed how to plan a data visualization and analysis project like this in a way that "bakes-in" reproducible workflows from the very beginning.

Here's the figure we generated:
