Rick will briefly talk about the Datasaurus dozen (see figure above).
This is an entertaining demonstration about the importance of visualizing data.

The visual acuity project team will a discussion about the draft protocol.

Rick and Andrea will a how-to session based on some reaction time data Andrea collected in her son Alex's class last year.
We will discuss how to plan a data visualization and analysis project like this in a way that "bakes-in" reproducible workflows from the very beginning.
