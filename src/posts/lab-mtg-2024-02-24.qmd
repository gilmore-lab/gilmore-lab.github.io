[Belle Peterson](../who-we-are.qmd#belle-peterson) talked about our first pilot PLAY participant.

We agreed to push discussion of this paper until two weeks from now:

Franconeri, S. L., Padilla, L. M., Shah, P., Zacks, J. M., & Hullman, J. (2021). The Science of Visual Data Communication: What Works. *Psychological Science in the Public Interest: A Journal of the American Psychological Society*, *22*(3), 110â€“161. https://doi.org/10.1177/15291006211051956

Rick and the [Legacy Project: Visual Acuity](https://gilmore-lab.github.io/visual-acuity/) team worked on a dashboard to track progress.
We found a bug in our code, but switching to the 'googlesheets4' package fixed our download errors.
Here is a figure from that workflow:
