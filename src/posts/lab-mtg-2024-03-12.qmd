Rick and the [Legacy Project: Visual Acuity](https://gilmore-lab.github.io/visual-acuity/) team talked about progress on this project.
We made progress in figuring out the best procedure for taking screenshots of data tables and where to store those screenshots for later data entry.

[Belle Peterson](../who-we-are.qmd#belle-peterson) talked about PLAY.

Next week we will read and discuss this paper:

Franconeri, S. L., Padilla, L. M., Shah, P., Zacks, J. M., & Hullman, J. (2021). The Science of Visual Data Communication: What Works. *Psychological Science in the Public Interest: A Journal of the American Psychological Society*, *22*(3), 110â€“161. https://doi.org/10.1177/15291006211051956
