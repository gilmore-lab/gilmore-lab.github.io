Dr. Gilmore led the journal club, and lab members discussed two different studies.

## Poster

### Synthesizing evidence about developmental patterns in human visual acuity as measured by Teller Acuity Cards

The poster presents a synthesis of published data on infant visual acuity measured with Teller Acuity Cards (TAC).

-   **Goal:** describe how acuity develops across the first years of life\
-   **Focus:** comparing monocular vs. binocular testing\
-   **Approach:**
    -   Collected data from published sources ([Gilmore Lab Poster](https://gilmore-lab.github.io/vss-2025-poster/vss-2025-poster.pdf))\
-   Extracted values when available\
-   Standardized and visualized results\
-   **Outcome:** developmental trends across studies using TAC-I and TAC-II

\## Paper (Neijzen et al., *Acta Ophthalmologica*, 2025) \### Reference values for the Teller Acuity Cards II in infants and preverbal children: a meta-analysis

This article provides updated reference norms for TAC-II in infants and preverbal children.

-   **Goal:** establish age-related benchmarks for clinical use\
-   **Method:**
    -   Meta-analysis of published datasets ([Wiley Link](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/aos.17447))\
-   Correction factor applied to adjust TAC-I data to TAC-II scale (\~0.3 octave)\
-   **Contribution:** standardized values for clinicians and researchers assessing infant vision

\## Meeting Discussion Summary

During our lab meeting, we:

-   Clarified the goals of the poster (developmental synthesis) vs. the paper (reference norms).\
-   Discussed strengths and limitations of the TAC method.\
-   Compared findings and compatibility issues between TAC-I and TAC-II.\
-   Reviewed basic statistical concepts relevant to meta-analysis and data harmonization.\
-   Reflected on the broader implications: how measuring infant visual acuity informs early visual development research and clinical practice.
