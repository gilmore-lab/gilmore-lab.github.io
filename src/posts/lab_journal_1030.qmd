Dr. Gilmore led the journal club and look over about data access and security.

During our meeting, we took a brief look at how large national brain-development studies manage and share their data, focusing on the HBCD and ABCD projects and the NIH Brain Development Cohorts (NBDC) platform.

- The NBDC platform provides an overview of available data-sets and aggregate information.

- Access to controlled data requires an approved account and a data use agreement.
qua
- Because neuroimaging and developmental data are highly sensitive, researchers must work within environments that meet NIST SP 800-171 or ISO/IEC 27001/27002 security standards.

- Research groups typically store and analyze these datasets on university-managed secure servers, HPC clusters, or restricted-access storage systems designed for compliance.

We also discussed the scale and infrastructure behind the NBDC platform and how such large data systems are maintained.
