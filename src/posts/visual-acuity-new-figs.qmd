Several RAs have taken the bull by the horns and made significant progress on the research protocol for the Legacy Project: Visual Acuity study.

In the meantime, Rick went ahead and made a very preliminary plot of what the eventual study-level data might look like:

With a bit of tweaking of some archival data, Rick also wrangled the following plot of some individual-level data.
