Gilmore's research focuses on the development of visual perception and memory. 
He is particularly interested in the development of brain networks that enable perceivers to extract information about the layout of the environment, the shape of objects, and the speed and direction of self-movement from patterns of visual motion called optic flow. 
Gilmore is also keenly interested in developing tools and practices that make scientific research more open, transparent, and reproducible.
He is co-founder and Co-Director of the [Databrary.org](https://databrary.org) data library, and is co-PI on the Play & Learning Across a Year [(PLAY) Project](https://play-project.org). 
From 2008 to 2014, Gilmore served as the founding Director of Human Imaging at Penn State's Social, Life, and Engineering Sciences Imaging Center [(SLEIC)](https://imaging.psu.edu).
