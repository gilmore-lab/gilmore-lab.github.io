## For Interested Students

The Brain Development Lab, part of the [Psychology Department](https://psych.la.psu.edu) at Penn State, is looking for research assistants to study brain development in infants, children, and adolescents for **Fall 2019**. You can earn research project (PSY 494) credit or work study funds, and learn video, computer, and communication skills. Prior research experience and computer skills are a plus, but aren't required. We are especially interested in students who have morning availability, computer skills, or are interested in developing skills in advertising, marketing, or public relations. You may apply by completing an [application](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1HgafpfTVPyMk_Wzf4b_ubzig_fs4lFGS6qh_y0sa0uE/viewform).

## Lab Director

Rick O. Gilmore is Professor of Psychology, a Huck Institute of the Life Sciences faculty member, and an Associate of the Institute for Cyberscience. He earned his bachelor's degree *magna cum laude* in Cognitive Science from [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu), and master's and doctoral degrees in Psychology from [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu) where he participated in the [Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition (CNBC)](https://cnbc.cmu.edu) training program in cognitive neuroscience. Gilmore's research focuses on the development of visual perception and memory. He is particularly interested in the development of brain networks that enable perceivers to extract information about the layout of the environment, the shape of objects, and the speed and direction of self-movement from patterns of visual motion called optic flow. Gilmore is also keenly interested in developing tools and practices that make scientific research more open, transparent, and reproducible. He is co-founder and Co-Director of the [Databrary.org](https://databrary.org) data library, and is co-PI on the Play & Learning Across a Year [(PLAY) Project](https://play-project.org) 

From 2008 to 2014, Gilmore served as the founding Director of Human Imaging at Penn State's Social, Life, and Engineering Sciences Imaging Center [(SLEIC)](https://imaging.psu.edu). He has won the College of the Liberal Arts tenure-line faculty teaching award, leads the Human Developmental Neuroscience Initiative for the Child Study Center, and has had support for his research from the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation. Gilmore has served as president of the [Centre Region Bicycle Coalition](https://centrebike.org), the [Acoustic Brew Concert Series](https://acousticbrew.org), and the [State College Community Theatre](https://scctonline.org).

### Yiming Qian, Graduate Student

Yiming is a graduate student in the Department of Psychology at PSU. Her research interest is exploring the development of brain networks from early childhood to adulthood, using multimodal neuroimaging tools. She is also interested in the mechanism of visual motion. Here is her [schedule](https://rstudio-connect.tlt.psu.edu:3939/content/22/projects_scheme.html) for the current research projects.

Besides research activities, Yiming enjoys reading, cooking, gardening, hiking and fishing. She is a big fan of operas and musicals.

### Michelle Mendez, Undergraduate Student 

Michelle Mendez is a sophomore majoring in Psychology. She is still contemplating on whether she wants to pursue a Neuroscience concentration or a Life Sciences concentration. She is from the city of Philadelphia where she spent most summers volunteering at a local recreational center. She is interested in adolescents and how they develop. She also has a great interest in mental illness, what causes it to develop, and how one can minimize the effects. 

She plans on furthering her research experience over the next few years, and plans on attending graduate school after she graduates.

### Sandy Rayes, Undergraduate Student 

Sandy is a junior double majoring in Biology and Psychology. She is active on campus as a previous orientation leader, membership director for [Blue and White Society](https://www.bluewhitesociety.com), and [THON](https://thon.org) captain.
