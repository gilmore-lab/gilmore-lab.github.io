<h1>For Interested Students</h1>
<p>The Brain Development Lab, part of the <a
href="https://psych.la.psu.edu">Psychology Department</a> at Penn State,
is looking for research assistants to study brain development in
infants, children, and adolescents for <strong>Fall 2022</strong>. You
can earn research project (PSY 494) credit or work study funds, and
learn video, computer, and communication skills. Prior research
experience and computer skills are a plus, but aren’t required. We are
especially interested in students who have morning availability,
computer skills, or are interested in developing skills in advertising,
marketing, or public relations. You may apply by completing an <a
href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1HgafpfTVPyMk_Wzf4b_ubzig_fs4lFGS6qh_y0sa0uE/viewform">application</a>.

of brain networks that enable perceivers to extract information about
the layout of the environment, the shape of objects, and the speed and
direction of self-movement from patterns of visual motion called optic
flow. Gilmore is also keenly interested in developing tools and
practices that make scientific research more open, transparent, and
reproducible. He is co-founder and Co-Director of the <a
